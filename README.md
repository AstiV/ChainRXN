# Game idea

The goal of this game is to make all balls explode - with just one click. Generate explosions in a chain reaction - good luck!

<!-- Running the game locally
Browsers like Google Chrome does not allow local files to load ajax requests. Because of this you need to either upload the game to a web server or disable this security permission.

In Google Chrome you can do this by adding --allow-file-access-from-files to the command args for Chrome. -->
